ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS: REPOSITORY SCAN

After generating the structured SRS from the specification document,
perform a **repository analysis** to detect functionality that may
exist in the code but is not documented in the specification.

Your task is to perform a lightweight **reverse engineering of system features**.

Repository analysis rules:

1. Scan the repository structure and relevant source code files.
2. Identify implemented behaviors, endpoints, services, or features.
3. Compare these with the SRS requirements.
4. Detect possible **undocumented functionality**.

OUTPUT AN ADDITIONAL SECTION:

# Funcionalidades Identificadas no Código

List behaviors or features discovered from the repository that are
not clearly documented in the specification.

Use this format:

UF-1: Description of the functionality inferred from the code  
Evidence: file(s) or module(s) where it appears

Example:

UF-1: The system appears to support password reset via email.  
Evidence: `auth/resetPassword.js`, `emailService.js`

UF-2: The system exposes a REST endpoint for exporting reports.  
Evidence: `routes/reportRoutes.js`

# Possíveis Lacunas na Especificação

List features that appear implemented but are missing from the specification.

# Inconsistências Detectadas

Identify cases where:

- the specification describes something not implemented
- the code implements something not described

# Recomendações de Atualização da Especificação

Suggest how the SRS could be updated to incorporate the discovered behavior.
